--------- SELF TESTS ---------

Run kshell command on weenix prompt before performing EACH of the following test cases. It will launch kshell$ prompt and all the following commands available in the kshell menu can now be executed. (type help) 

KNOWN PROBLEMS:
        - Sometimes we observed that, Running the command on the Kshell prompt doesnot do anything. 
          It is a very random behaviour. If this is encountered, please try re-running the command.
